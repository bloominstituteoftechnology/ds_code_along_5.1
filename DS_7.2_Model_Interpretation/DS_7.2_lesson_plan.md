# Code-Along Lesson Plan: DS 7.2 - Model Interpretation

This lesson plan template is aimed at preparing instructors to deliver a high quality live session to learners who have already prepared to work on the project by setting up any prerequisites before coming to class.

## Prep List

- [ ] Watch the lesson plan overview video. ***Link to be included once lesson plan is complete***
- [ ] After watching the lesson overview, internalize lesson plan in full
- [ ] Make a copy of the [```DS_7.2-learner.ipynb```]() notebook. Set it up either on Google Colab or local machine, (clone or download the dataset from Github,update the ```DATE_PATH``` variable if working locally), and be prepared to teach the live session
- [ ] If you are running code in your live session, make sure it works and the solution code is accurate
- [ ] If your lesson plan includes technical steps, be sure to have walked through them first before teaching

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Engage Classroom (1-2 min.)

- ***Remind learners of classroom expectations during live Code-Along instruction:***
  - Web cameras need to be on to have the best learning experience possible
  - Talk about how we are going to be using specific communication tools like Slido, Zoom, etc. during the live session
  - If you need additional technical support that goes beyond this Code-Along, please use the Hub's knowledge base to start or schedule 1:1 support

- ***Pick one activity*** to help build an online community here at BloomTech and get learners excited for live instruction:
  - ***Icebreaker:*** Fun activity that helps learners get to know one another
  - ***Pulse Check:*** Pose a question for learners to gauge how they are feeling/get a pulse on how where they are at this point in the course
  - ***Do Now:*** Pose a question that involves no guidance from you. Used to activate students’ learning for the lesson, surface prior knowledge from pre-work, and familiarize students with today’s content
  - ***Celebrations:*** Share a learner celebration, job offer, remind students why they are putting in all this hard work

- Remind learners of classroom expectations during live code along instruction

### 2. Getting Started (3-5 min.)

- State that the learners should have already completed their prerequisite project set up before joining this live session
- Remind learners what they’ve worked on up until now in this sprint, to get to this point:
  - Permutation Importances
  - Boosted models
  - Partial Dependence and Shapley plots

- Utilize a metaphor or an analogy to get learners excited to learn the key concepts. 
  - Feature Importances
  - Model Interpretation

- Highlight the key concepts that will be covered during the live session
  - Permutation Importances 
  - Developing Partial Dependence and Shapley plots

- Explain how these concepts are designed with the sprint challenge in mind and how it’s critical to the job

### 3. What Will We Be Building In This Code Along? (2-3 min.)

***Preview End Result:*** Today we will work with the RestoreMasters dataset on cars and review why model interpretation is important. By the end of this lesson, you will understand why feature importances can sometimes be be misleading and how to get the permutation importances instead. YOu will aslo learn how to build partial dependence and shapley plots. 

### 4. Let’s Build (30 min.)

Follow each step as outlined in the steps template in the [```DS_7.2-Intructor.ipynb```](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/code_along_main/blob/main/DS_Core/Unit_2/Sprint_7/Code_Along_2/DS_7.2-Instructor.ipynb) notebook.

### 5. Wrap Up (7-10 min.)

- ***Answer questions*** in a question and answer format, time permitting
- ***Restate*** the key concepts and why the project was important to the job Q&A for the whole project time permitting
- ***Review*** next steps in the learner journey as it relates to the sprint of learning.  Example:  If you are in code along 1, you would encourage the learner to spend time with the next two learning modules before attending code along 2 for this sprint
- ***Encourage*** learners to sign up for another live code along or repeat this one if they want to review it again
